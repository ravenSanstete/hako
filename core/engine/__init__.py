The optimization routine for the hako system.

Which can be a hard work to do. And since a self-organizing prototype may be implemented,
the responsibility of some supreum optimization macro will be of high value

This is named as engine. It's responsible to organize the runtime env of all the key components

and may use the wrapping layer keras, which, however, doesn't mean that we will not invoke the functions
of tensorflow
