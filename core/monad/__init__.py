Monad: the realization or in a plain text, the production of prototype machines

In morino's ideal model of the real world, each individual(here take a general meaning, images, texts
can be called individuals as well) is a realization(mixture of several distinct prototype). Since the prototype
may be homogeneous or not. There is an intense need to model the concept as an abstract class

######################### Illustration for Concept
[Summation Convention is complied with]
u_a = a^i*Proto_i.exposure();

s.t. a^i*1_i=1;
s.t  forall{i} Proto_i.exposure() \in R^k, k is a constant

Here, it's just a linear combine of prototypes with the restriction of probability summed to 1
